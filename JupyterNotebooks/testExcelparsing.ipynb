Upon arrival, city units found active fire behavior and requested assistance from Forestry.\n\nForestry resources responded and found the fire to be approximately 1 acre in size, exhibiting Rank 1 fire behavior, burning in duff, grass, and leaf litter with 100% active perimeter. Fuels were continuous, consisting of hardwood and grass understory. Terrain was flat with calm winds. The fire appeared to be burning deep, lightning-caused, with heat detected 3 to 4 feet below the surface. No visible smoke was observed, though residual heat remained along the fire’s edge. Suppression efforts focused on those remaining hotspots.\n\n",
